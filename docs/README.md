# Currents Self-Hosted Documentation

Currents on-premise installation is a series of microservices provided as container images that are installed into a Kubernetes Cluster using the Currents Helm Chart.

The Currents Helm Chart is stateless, so depends on being connected to stateful services like a Database and Object Storage. These connected stateful services can be deployed inside the Kubernetes cluster alongside Currents, or outside the cluster.

## Upstream Services

- The self-hosted solution requires an existing Identity Provider for access provisioning.
- The recommended configuration for the stateful services (MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Clickhouse) may not be adequate for all production loads.
- Currents team doesn't provide support for the upstream services (MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Clickhouse), see [Support Policy](./support.md).
